About me
=====
I am a Quantitative Researcher at Citadel Securities. Previously, I was a Researcher at Microsoft Research and a Research Scientist Intern at Meta AI. I defended my PhD in April 2023 at CREST - ENSAE, [Institut Polytechnique de Paris](https://www.ip-paris.fr) where I worked under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net).

Research Interests
=====
I have a keen interest in foundation models and world models, specifically focusing on how foundation models can articulate their comprehension of the world and optimize for decision-making.

Throughout my doctoral studies, my primary focus revolved around applying optimal transport to tackle large-scale challenges in Machine Learning. I also delved into its close connections with diverse applications within the machine learning domain, including areas like adversarial robustness, fair division, and the modeling of recent architectures like triangular flows and transformers.
