I hold a masterâ€™s degre in Mathematics, Computer Vision and statistical learning from Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay. I spend my final year in a research program funded by Ecole Normale Superieure Paris-Saclay which is a complete year of study devoted to work in an academic research laboratory abroad. More details can be found in my [CV](/files/my_cv.pdf).
