I am currently a third year PhD student in the Department of Statistics at CREST - ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique de Paris under the supervision of Marco Cuturi.
Before that, I was a student at ENS Paris-Saclay in the Department of Mathematics. My years spent at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay allowed me to get acquainted with a very large spectrum of mathematical fields. In particular, it is during my studies at ENS Paris-Saclay that I understood what I was most passionate about, namely mathematics applied to machine learning. Therefore I wanted to specialize myself in this field and I decided to do a research year abroad as part of my studies at ENS Paris-Saclay. At that time, I was extremely curious to discover two particular domains: deep learning and sparse coding for signal processing. I first went to Seattle, in the statistics department at the University of Washington, under the supervision of [Zaid Harchaoui] (http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/). My research project was the statistical study of deep neural networks by embedding them into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then I went to Haifa, in the department of computer science at the Technion under the supervision of [Michael Elad](https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il). There, we redesigned a classical dictionary learning algorithm based on sparse coding methods for image denoising using neural networks.
More details can be found in my [CV](/files/CV_Meyer.pdf).
