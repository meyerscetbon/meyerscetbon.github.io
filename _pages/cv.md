I am currently a Researcher at Microsoft Research Cambridge, UK, where I work in the Causica Team led by [Cheng Zhang](https://cheng-zhang.org) since May 2023. Before that, I was a Research Scientist Intern at Meta AI, Paris. I obtained my Ph.D. in April 2023 under the supervision of [Marco Cuturi](https://marcocuturi.net) from CREST - ENSAE, Institut Polytechnique. Before my Ph.D., I was a student at Ecole Normale Sup√©rieure Paris-Saclay in the Department of Mathematics. During my studies there, I had the chance to spend more than a year abroad and work in different research laboratories. I first went to Seattle, in the statistics department at the University of Washington, under the supervision of [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/). Then I went to Haifa, in the department of computer science at the Technion under the supervision of [Michael Elad](https://elad.cs.technion.ac.il). 

More details can be found in my [CV](/files/cv_meyer.pdf).
